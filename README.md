# constraint-propogation

Inspired by chapter 3.3.5 of SICP, this is a project that implements a constraints based propogation system in C++.

The idea is that given a complex mathematical equation with constants and symbols, assigning values to symbols will have the propogation system determine whatever the remaining unknowns' values are in the equation, if the system has enough information.
